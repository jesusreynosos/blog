## About me.

I'd like to start my blog describing *who* am I.
My name is **Jesus David Emiliano Reynoso Sarmiento** which is a loong name, so just call me David or "Chucho" which is a nickname for people named Jesus.
I was born in Mexico. I lived in different places but at the moment I live in Tlaxcala.
In 2014, I started a new adventure as a med student.
Nowadays my interests are traslational research and data science.
I have an entrepreneur spirit in me. I would like to make medical processes more efficient.
