# **My new blog**

## About me.

I'd like to start my blog describing *who* am I.
My name is **Jesus David Emiliano Reynoso Sarmiento** which is a loong name, so just call me David.
I was born in Puebla, raised in Morelos and then I came back to my home town in 2014.
I started a new adventure back then as a med student.
Nowadays my interests are traslational research and data science.
I have an entrepreneur spirit in me, I want to be on the cutting edge of the fields I like and make the world a better place.
