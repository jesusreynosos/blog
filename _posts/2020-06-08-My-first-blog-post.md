# *This is a small step for a man but a great leap for mankind*
Ok, now onto my first post.
We have a new pandemic now, it's been about 6 months but it feels like it's been ages since we can't live the way we used to.
The schools have been closed, work was stopped, I came back to my house and started so much new projects.
But I can't tell it's been the best for all of us. US unemployment rate became as much as [14.7 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/05/may-2020-jobs-report/).
Here in Mexico the unemployment rate became as big as [25 percent](https://www.forbes.com.mx/economia-desempleo-mexico-casi-25-poblacion-heath/) because much of our labor workforce is unregistered.
This just makes you re-think everything. But as the panorama looks uncertain we have to keep moving forward. 
I'm eager to go back to my hospital and help as many patients as I can.
What do you want to do next?
